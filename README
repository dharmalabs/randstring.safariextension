Simple JS to generate a password string 8 characters in length with settings to
include numbers and/or caps. It's invoked from the context menu and displays a
popup with your fancy-schmancy new password string. This was a
"scratch-your-own-itch" quickie project and general curiosity with writing an
extension.

Before you can install this extension, you will need to signup for the Safari
Developer Program to obtain a developer certficate.

Once the certificate is installed you can sign the extension. To add the
extension, open Extension Builder and add randstring.safariextension.

TODO:

Adding an arbitrary string length option would be nice, but:
  a. The slider in extensions builder is lame since it doesn't tell the user
     what the value is.
  b. Tried hacking the JS to peek into the extensions settings window and
     update the slider label but the settings window is outside of the sandbox.
  c. A textfield is lame because there's no validation and the user can put
     whatever they want into the field.
  d. The only option seems to be creating a special options page instead of the
     default built by extensions builder.
